  Analyze the given medical image and describe its visual characteristics. This includes as side heading:

Modality: What type of image is it? (e.g., X-ray, MRI, CT scan)
Anatomy: What anatomical structures are visible in the image? (e.g., bones, muscles, organs)
Key features: Identify any prominent features or abnormalities in the image. (e.g., fractures, lesions, tumors)
Spatial relationships: Describe the positions and relationships between different structures. (e.g., organ displacement, tissue density variations)

Additional notes:

Be specific about the types of medical images your application will support.
Clearly state that the output is a description of visual features, not a medical diagnosis.
Emphasize the importance of seeking professional medical advice for any health concerns.
